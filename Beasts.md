### Mail to: Brett
Time for the next step for The Beast's marketing.
I've been talking to MCC about making the colours pop and they sent a heap of samples with shiny/metal as the base. It changed the labels alot more than I expected. I'd like to go with a 75% base, which lets the colour be bold and still adds a nice shine, making the colour look just a little more complex. The white and black will be matt, still. Not really any change need on your end there, just wanted to keep you up to date.
I would like to remove the balck line at the bottom of the can, and the text that was there with it - just have colour top to bottom.
I'd like to have a little more story in the pictograms, about where we are with the coffee is great. For some of them, like Leonard, that could be as simple as a more cast shadow. If possible I think it'd be cool to have them be "lit" from the same location, behind and to the left maybe.
I'd like all the text (which I'll be reducing overall) to be on one side of the label, so the can as a whole reads in one direction left to right. This could also play nicely with the cast shadow.
To help understand what I'm talking about I modified a Leonard Label (attached), if it still doesn't make sense feel free to give me a call.
One thing not on my modified label, but will be needed on some, is Ⅱ (that's 2 in roman numerals) after the name as they're the second generation. Maybe as superscript after the name? Leonard is one that will need it and is a good one to get it work on as his name is probably going to be as long as it gets. This numbering of batches will continue, so keep in mind, there'll eventually be Leonard Ⅷ for instance.
