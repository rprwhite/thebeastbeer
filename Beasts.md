### Mail to: Brett
G'day Brett,

Hope everything's going well with you.
Here it's time for the next step for The Beast's marketing.
I've been talking to MCC about making the colours pop and they sent a heap of samples with shiny/metal as the base. It changed the labels alot more than I expected. I'd like to go with a 75% base, which lets the colour be bold and still adds a nice shine, making the colour look just a little more complex. The white and black will be matt, still. Not really any change need on your end there, just wanted to keep you up to date.
I would like to remove the balck line at the bottom of the can, and the text that was there with it - just have colour top to bottom.
I'd like to have a little more story in the pictograms, about where we are with the coffee is great. For some of them, like Leonard, that could be as simple as a more cast shadow. If possible I think it'd be cool to have them be "lit" from the same location, behind and to the left maybe.
I'd like all the text (which I'll be reducing overall) to be on one side of the label, so the can as a whole reads in one direction left to right. This could also play nicely with the cast shadow.
To help understand what I'm talking about I modified a Leonard Label (attached), if it still doesn't make sense feel free to give me a call.
One thing not on my modified label, but will be needed on some, is Ⅱ (that's 2 in roman numerals) after the name as they're the second generation. Maybe as superscript after the name? Leonard is one that will need it and is a good one to get it work on as his name is probably going to be as long as it gets. This numbering of batches will continue, so keep in mind, there'll eventually be Leonard Ⅷ (8 in roman numerals) for instance.

The brand as a whole is coming together more and more. One thing I want is use the solid imprint for the beast head logo, rather than the silhouette, just the inverse really. The silhouette doesn't shrink well, too much going on. I see it as a logo that can be used either way. But, there are some changes to make it work well in both styles.
 - I'd like the horns to be more prominent, this is particularly important for the imprint style. How exactly I leave to you, we could whole hog with big mountain goat style horns, just a tiny upward turn at the end, or somethign inbetween. Whatever you recommend here.
 - Take the centre of the bow tie out, this balances the 'holes' top to bottom and helps reduce complexity when the logo is shrunk
 - A very minor thing, the first leaf (closest to the horns) has a little zig zag to it, probably just an oversight in its original creation, lets make it smooth.

The beer lines have also come together, they will mostly fit in one of three ranges; Farmhouse Ales, Fruited Sour, or Gluten Free IPA. They each have a bit of theme.

Farmhouse Ales are complex beers which are designed to be enjoyed slowly. The imagery should be primarily related farm, or mining, work or anything that embodies old-timery. The images should also be relaxed, or seem that way (eg. a hat leaning against an invisible wall, or a shirt hung on one side and slouched on the other, or a mining helmet with torch on the ground).
Upcoming farmhouse ales for which labels are needed:
- Jack II
	- Style: Common Farmhouse Ale
	- Colour: Yellow (as before)
	- Image: A cowboy hat leaning against an invisible wall and a pair of running shoes in front of it.
	- Story: Jack II is a co-ferment between lager and ale yeasts. He's a little of both worlds; the wild (cowboy hat/farmhouse yeast) and the straight-narrow (running shoes/ lager yeast).
- Alice
	- Style: Sour Saison
	- Colour: Yellowy-orange
	- Image: A high-vis work vest hung from one side with a big white strip for the reflective part. And, a rabbit when the name would go or maybe a rabbit shaped shadow.
	- Story: Alice is a bit of a crossover between sour line and the farmhouse line so needs a bit of whimsy in the label.

Fruited Sours are fun beers, an explosion of flavour. The sort beer that leaves you confused and bewildered, but with a massive grin. The imagery should be reminiscient of fairy-tales or silliness, ideally with just a bit more going on than the current sour labels. The overall theme here is fun and whimsy.
Upcoming sours for which labels are needed:
- Edna II
	- Style: Pastry Sour
	- Colour: Dark red-pink (as before)
	- Image: I'm thinking the edna glasses in a waffle cone, maybe with ice-cream maybe not
	- Story: She's like a decadent strawberry ice-cream, including the waffle cone, turned into a sour beer. 
- Gretel II
	- Style: Fruited Sour
	- Colour: Yellow-green (as before)
	- Image: The fox ears riding a bunch of elderflower
	- Story: As we're coming to the cooler months she's bigger, bolder, and a bit more crazy. Now fruited with elderflower, kakadu plum, and burnt honey.

The Gluten Free IPAs are hoppy beers that are great after work beers, or after running around or whatever. I've had quite a few people comment they don't feel bloated after them, compared to regular IPAs, even though the people aren't gluten intolerant - which may be something we can use in the marketing. The imagery should be primarily sporty and in-action, or movement (eg. the mid-walk of Leonard's shorts, I'd also like to change Hugh to a tethered ball-on-rope where the rope is curved around to make it look like a question mark - who/hugh joke, but that's for the future).
Upcoming Gluten Free IPAs for which labels are needed:
- Bishop
	- Style: Barrel Aged IPA
	- Colour: Orangey-purple
	- Image: A pair of thongs/flip-flops, maybe one mid-step, with footprints behind them going off into the distance.
	- Story: He's been in barrel for quite some time and he's a uniquely Beast thing. He's also something I'll be doing more of - so if we can knock this one out of the park it would be awesome.
- Leonard II
	- Style: Session IPA
	- Colour: Blue (as before)
	- Image: Mostly as before, with more white and shadow, or something, to give the shorts just little more an in-motion feeling.
	- Story: ABV is a little lower, so he's even more focused on the session part.

All the labels will have less text on the front, it was just confusing people. To otherside can we add the pregnancy warning, as required (though the deadline is next year, let's add it now). I'm going to drop the "likes..." part and try and keep the "G'day, I'm..." part to a minimum to fit in the space. I'm thinking have the "G'day" section at the top running the full length, then a new five word description section below it, a health claim (contains gluten/lactose, etc) below that, then the rest however fits best.

So that's: an update to the logo, 4x updated labels, and 2x new labels
Let's call that Milestone 1, can we get that completed and have the labels to MCC on 9 May?

For Milestone 2 I'd like to have:
- Some Fellowship of Flavour imagery to go along with the updated logo on merch, particularly hoodies, stubby coolers, and coasters.
- Some imagery for social media, particularly of the labels/cans, and a poster size/style for one of the labels - I'm thinking Alice. She's out there, a blend of two product lines, and can have an amusing tagline, "Alice, Alice, who the bloody hell is Alice?"
Could we get that done by 23 May?

Let me know your thoughts, and/or questions.
Cheers,
