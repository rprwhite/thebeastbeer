# The Sophisticated Beast
> Beer & seltzer
> Unconventional, not unsophisticated
> Serious about flavour, in all forms
> A fellowship of flavour
> Adventurous beers created with sophistication

We make seriously small batches, we don’t have a volume play beer to reach the masses. We are creating a fellowship of flavour for those that are seeking something mind-expanding. *not fond of mind-expanding, maybe replace with sophisticated* 

## Random thoughts
- We release beers on a bimonthly schedule
- Pre-orders
- One man show
- Gamification

## Problems (and their solutions)
### People don’t know what The Sophisticated Beast does
Use Instagram, Facebook, and maybe Twitter and TikTok to tell the world we brew beer and make seltzer.

## Beast.beer
> Big/Apple-style product pages
> White for seltzer, Black for beer
> Support light/dark system styles
> Gamification
> Timeline/Tumblr/Hey blog style
> Not cheap

### Gretal
G’day, I’m Gretal, an elderflower Berliner Weisse. Some people say I’m floral and pretty tart. But, I like to think of myself as refreshing.
#### Likes
Sunshine (or pretending it’s that way), spicy food, and getting the day started early.
#### Details
ABV: 4.1%
Std drinks:
Made from: Wheat, barley, and oats, with elderflower from our garden
Vintage: 2021

### Hugh
G’day, I’m Hugh, an Aussie hazy. I’m jacked up with a bit of wattleseed, a little fruity thanks to Galaxy hops, and have a hint of sourness, and funk, from my time in barrel. Oh, and I’m gluten free. You could say I’m all singing and all dancing.
#### Likes
BBQs (can’t go past a snag on bread), after work bevvies, or catching the latest blockbuster.
#### Details
ABV: 3.5%
Std drinks:
Made from: Sorghum, wattleseed, and Galaxy hops
Vintage: 2021

### Humphrey
G’day, I’m Humphrey, a farmhouse style Kölsch. I’m a smidge more tart than you might expect. But, don’t let that fool you, I’m still malty and comforting - like a warm hug from a big brown bear.
#### Likes
Hearty meals, relaxing moments, and long walks on the beach.
#### Details

Std drinks:
Made from: Barley and wheat, with Warrior and Hallertauer Mittelfrueh hops

### Edna
Hello possums, I’m Edna, a cream IPA that spent time on Fragola grape skins, which gives me a delightful strawberry lift. I’m a bit creamy, a bit tart, a bit sweet, and a bit bitter. There’s a lot going on here - the question is do you share or savour?
#### Likes
Swirling around a glass, savouring a moment, and sharing with friends.
#### Details
ABV: 6.3%
Std drinks:
Made from: Barley, wheat, oats, and lactose, with some Fragola grape skins
